##  What is an Operating System?
```
An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an interface between the user and computer hardware.
It manages CPU, memory, storage, devices, and allows applications to run.

Examples: Linux, Windows, macOS, Unix
```
##Types of Operating Systems
```
1 Batch Operating System:
Jobs are collected and executed in batches
No user interaction during execution
Example: Payroll systems

2 Time-Sharing Operating System:
Multiple users share CPU time
Fast response time
Example: Linux, Unix

3 Distributed Operating System:
Multiple systems work together as one
Improves reliability and performance
Example: Cluster systems

4 Network Operating System:
Manages network resources
Used in client-server environments
Example: Linux Server, Windows Server

5 Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):
Processes data within strict time limits
Used in embedded and critical systems
Example: RTLinux, VxWorks
```
## What is a Server?
```
A server is a computer or system that provides services, resources, or data to other computers (clients) over a network.
Examples of Server Types:
Web Server – Hosts websites
File Server – Stores and shares files
Database Server – Manages databases
Application Server – Runs backend applications
```
```
💡Most production servers use Linux due to its stability, security, and zero licensing cost.

## Linux vs Windows

## Differences:
```
| Feature           | Linux                  | Windows               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Cost**          | Free & Open Source     | Paid                  |
| **Source Code**   | Open                   | Closed                |
| **Security**      | Very strong            | More malware-prone    |
| **Performance**   | Lightweight            | Resource heavy        |
| **Customization** | High                   | Limited               |
| **Stability**     | Very stable            | Needs frequent reboot |
| **Usage**         | Servers, Cloud, DevOps | Desktop, Gaming       |

```
## Desktop OS vs Server OS

## Differences:
```
| Feature         | Desktop OS                   | Server OS                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Personal use                 | Provide services           |
| **Users**       | Single / Few                 | Multiple users             |
| **GUI**         | Mandatory                    | Optional                   |
| **Performance** | Moderate                     | High & optimized           |
| **Use Case**    | Daily computing, office work | Hosting, networking, cloud |
| **Examples**    | Ubuntu Desktop, Windows 11   | RHEL, Ubuntu Server        |

# Linux Architecture
## Linux Architecture Diagram

Text Diagram (for reference):


|   User Applications  |
|       Shell          |
|  System Libraries    |
|       Kernel         |
|      Hardware        |


## Linux Architecture Components
## a. Hardware
```
Physical components like CPU, RAM, disk, network devices
```
## b. Kernel
```
Core of Linux OS
Manages:Process scheduling, Memory management, Device drivers, File systems
```
## c. System Libraries
```
Provide functions used by applications
Help applications interact with the kernel
```
## d. Shell
```
Command-line interface
Acts as a bridge between user and kernel
Examples: bash, sh, zsh
```
## e. User Applications
```
Software used by users
Examples: browsers, editors, servers
```

## Popular Linux Distributions:
```
Ubuntu – Beginner-friendly, desktop & server
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) – Enterprise use
CentOS / Rocky Linux – RHEL-based free distros
Debian – Stable and secure
Kali Linux – Cybersecurity & penetration testing
Amazon Linux – Optimized for AWS
```
